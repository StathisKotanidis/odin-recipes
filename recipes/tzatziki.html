    <h2>Tzatziki! Tsaht-ZEE-kee! </h2>

    <p>Tzatziki is made simply with yogurt, drained cucumber, olive oil, fresh herbs (usually mint or dill), garlic,
        lemon juice and salt. It’s a refreshing chilled sauce, dip or spread.Tzatziki is often served with grilled meats
        and gyros, but I can’t think of a grilled or roasted vegetable it wouldn’t play nicely with. You can also serve
        up some tzatziki with your next appetizer spread. Let’s make some already!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups grated cucumber (from about 1 medium 10-ounce cucumber, no need to peel or seed the cucumber first,
            grate on the large holes of your box grater)</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint and/or dill</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 medium clove garlic, pressed or minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Working with one big handful at a time, lightly squeeze the grated cucumber between your palms over the sink
            to remove excess moisture. Transfer the squeezed cucumber to a serving bowl, and repeat with the remaining
            cucumber.</li>
        <li>Add the yogurt, olive oil, herbs, lemon juice, garlic, and salt to the bowl, and stir to blend. Let the
            mixture rest for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Taste and add additional chopped fresh herbs, lemon
            juice, and/or salt, if necessary (I thought this batch was just right as-is).</li>
        <li>Serve tzatziki immediately or chill for later. Leftover tzatziki keeps well, chilled, for about 4 days.</li>

    </ol>
