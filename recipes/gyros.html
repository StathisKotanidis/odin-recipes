        <li>2 kilos pork</li>
        <li>50 g seed oil</li>
        <li>50 g olive oil</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoon(s) mustard</li>
        <li>50 g vinegar, white wine</li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon(s) cumin</li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoon(s) salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon(s) paprika, sweet</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon(s) chili flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon(s) pepper</li>
        <li>50 g honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon(s) garlic, powder or 3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon(s) onion, powder or 1 onion into slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon(s) oregano</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the meat into thin slices. Tenderize the meat with a mallet to soften the slices, make them very thin,
            and set them aside.</li>
        <li>In a bowl add the seed oil, olive oil, mustard, vinegar, cumin, salt, paprika, chili flakes, pepper, honey,
            garlic, onion, oregano, and mix.</li>
        <li>Put the meat into the bowl with the marinade and mix well. Ideally, you should refrigerate it, covered with
            plastic wrap, for 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180° C (350° F) set to fan.</li>
        <li>Cut a potato in half and thread the pieces onto 2 wooden skewers. Put them in a baking pan, with the cut
            side facing down. The potato will be the base for the gyros. Thread the pork slices, one by one, onto the
            skewers.</li>
        <li>Cut the tomato into slices, the pepper into pieces, and the onion into four pieces. Thread the veggies onto
            the skewers, above the gyros. </li>
        <li>Wrap with aluminum foil and bake for 3 hours. Uncover and bake for another 30-40 minutes until golden brown.

    </ol>
