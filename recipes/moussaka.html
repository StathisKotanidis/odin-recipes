    <h2>Moussaka (Greek Beef and Eggplant Lasagna)</h2>

    <p>Moussaka is to the Greek what Lasagna is to Italians. A rich tomato meat sauce layered with eggplant instead of
        pasta sheets, and topped with a thick layer of béchamel sauce, this traditional Greek recipe takes time to
        assemble – but it’s well worth the effort!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 kg / 2 lb eggplant (aubergines)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 - 3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>**The list is pretty big so i put a few ingredients. Full ingredients list here <a

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place eggplant slightly overlapping in a large colander. Sprinkle with some salt. Repeat with remaining
            eggplant.</li>
        <li>Leave to sweat for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make Meat Sauce and Béchamel Sauce.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 240C/450F. </li>
        <li>Pat eggplant dry - make sure to do this well, otherwise it's too salty. Lay on parchment paper lined trays
            (you might need 3 trays, work in batches), brush with oil.</li>
        <li>Bake 15 - 20 minutes or until lightly browned and softened . Remove and set aside to cool slightly.</li>
